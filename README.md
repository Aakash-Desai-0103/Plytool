# C++ Syntax Verification using PLY

A simple academic project that performs lexical and syntax analysis for a subset of C++ constructs using Python Lex-Yacc (PLY).

## Supported Constructs
- Simple data-type declarations  
- Array declarations  
- Function declarations (prototypes)  
- Function definitions  
- If–Else statements  

Each construct is parsed using a separate parser with a shared lexer.

## Tech Used
- Python  
- PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)  
- C++ (subset)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install ply
python main.py
